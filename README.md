## Project Overview

This notebook implements a machine learning pipeline for predicting solar irradiance. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the results.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes solar irradiance measurements along with relevant features. It is assumed that the dataset is preloaded into the notebook.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include:

- Handling missing values
- Normalizing the features
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

## Modeling

The modeling section involves:

- Building a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras
- Compiling the model with appropriate loss function and optimizer
- Training the model on the training dataset

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). The evaluation is performed on the test dataset.

## Results

The training process and evaluation metrics are visualized. The key results include:

- Loss and MSE over epochs
- Final Mean Absolute Error on the test set
